# Oracle – Book Discovery Platform

**Oracle** is a personal project that explores a new way to discover books, one that centers on how a story feels rather than how it's tagged or rated. It uses large language models (LLMs) and semantic embeddings to let readers describe exactly the kind of book they're looking for in natural language.

You might say:
> “A murder mystery with a strong female lead”  
> “A quiet, introspective novel about grief and magical realism”  
> “A fae fairytale rooted in real Celtic folklore”

Oracle takes that and returns book recommendations with plain-language explanations of why they were chosen. It's not trying to push what's popular — it's trying to understand what you're asking for.

## Why I'm Building This

This project started as a way to rethink how we interact with media. I’ve always felt that we should have more control and clarity over the content we engage with and more expressive tools to find it. I’m starting with books.

I realized through hours spent on booktok that I trust recommendations from people who’ve actually read and understood the books they're talking about. Friends, creators, people who can speak to tone, emotional impact, character arcs. That kind of intrinsic knowledge matters more to me than a star rating on Goodreads. I’d take a friend’s recommendation over an algorithm’s any day because a friend knows my taste *and* the book. Oracle is my attempt to build a system that reflects that kind of understanding. Oracle is not a product. It’s a project I’m building because I care about stories, about systems that understand nuance, and about exploring new applications of AI to classic problems in ways current platforms don’t.

## What It Does

- **Natural Language Search**  
  Describe what you're in the mood for in your own words. Oracle translates that into structured themes, tones, and narrative concepts.

- **Semantic Book Profiles**  
  Each book is processed through an LLM to create a detailed profile of not just keywords, but narrative structure, voice, emotional arc, and more.

- **Taste-Based Onboarding**  
  Start by picking a few books you’ve read and rate the elements you loved (or didn’t). Oracle uses that to shape future recommendations.

- **Explainable Recommendations**  
  Each result includes a brief explanation of why it was recommended and not just a title and cover.

- **Simple Feedback Loop**  
  You can give feedback on what works and what doesn’t. It’s not complicated, but it helps Oracle get closer to your taste over time.

Oracle is a tool I'm making for myself and others who care about stories, discovery, and the feeling of finding something that just *clicks*. It's still early, but I’m excited to keep building.
